# Team_CRYPTO--P2P_chat
 A peer-to-peer chat application in C++ that allows users to send and receive messages at the same time, supports communication with multiple peers, and enables users to check and retrieve a list of peers from whom they have received messages.

# Peer-to-Peer Chat Program in C++

## Overview
This is a simple peer-to-peer (P2P) chat application written in C++ using Winsock2. The program allows users to:
- Send and receive messages simultaneously.
- Communicate with multiple peers.
- Query and retrieve a list of peers from whom messages have been received.

## Features
- Peer-to-peer communication without a central server.
- Users can send messages directly to other peers using their IP address and port number.
- Keeps track of active peers in a session.
- Supports real-time message exchange.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Windows OS (required for Winsock2 API).
- Microsoft Visual Studio (or any C++ compiler supporting Winsock2).

## How to Compile and Run

### 1. Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/peer-to-peer-chat.git
cd peer-to-peer-chat
```

### 2. Compile the Code
If using g++, compile with:
```sh
g++ -o chat_program chat.cpp -lws2_32
```
For Microsoft Visual Studio, create a new C++ project and include the source code.

### 3. Run the Program
```sh
chat_program.exe
```

## How It Works
1. The program initializes Winsock2 and detects the local IP address.
2. The user provides a team name and selects a port for listening.
3. A server thread starts listening for incoming messages.
4. The user can choose from the following options:
   - **Send a message**: Enter the recipient's IP address and port to send a message.
   - **Query active peers**: Display a list of peers that have sent messages.
   - **Connect to known peers**: Send a connection message to previously contacted peers.
   - **Quit the program**: Exit the chat application.
5. Messages are formatted as:
   ``` sender_IP:port team_name message
   ```
6. The receiver stores the senderâ€™s information and displays the message.

## Example Usage
### User 1:
- IP: 192.168.1.10, Port: 5000
- Starts the program and listens for messages.

### User 2:
- IP: 192.168.1.11, Port: 6000
- Connects to User 1 and sends a message.

**Output on User 1's Screen:**
```
Message from 192.168.1.11:6000 [TeamB]: Hello, how are you?
```

- Ensure that firewall settings allow communication on the chosen ports.
